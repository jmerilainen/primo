Primo is a one-view starting page for the browsers. It shows the weather for the next 12 hours.
With a few themes available you can match the colors by your preferences.

Primo is heavily inspired by an actual Chrome extension that I used many years ago.
Unfortunately, I can't remember the exact name nor find it from Chrome Store to give
full credits.

## Usage

Primo uses the browser's geolocation to get your current position to fetch weather forecasts
for the location. If you don't allow location Primo will only show the current time.

From the top right, you can switch themes. Selection will be saved to local storage.
